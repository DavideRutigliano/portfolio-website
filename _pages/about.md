I'm a **Senior Platform Engineer** at [SUSE](https://www.suse.com/), where I identify systemic infrastructure gaps, design missing abstractions, and ship production-grade solutions adopted across teams and environments.

## What I Do

I specialize in building internal platforms and developer tools that scale. My work spans **Kubernetes**, **virtualization**, **observability**, and **asset governance** — with a focus on greenfield design, production readiness, and long-term maintainability.

### Recent Highlights

- 🚀 **62% infrastructure cost reduction** ($100K+ annual savings) by architecting Kubernetes Cluster Auto-scaling with Cluster API across AWS, GCP, and on-prem
- 🤖 **Built the SUSE Observability MCP Server** from idea to MVP, embedding LLM-driven analysis directly into the alerting pipeline — recognized by senior leadership for production hardening
- 🔄 **Designed VM migration orchestration** with a Kubernetes operator enabling 100+ VMs migration from KVM to Harvester
- 📊 **Architected federated observability** migration to SUSE Observability (StackState), cutting troubleshooting time by 25%
