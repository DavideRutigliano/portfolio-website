## Overview

Architected and delivered the **SUSE Observability MCP Server** from greenfield idea to production MVP. This project embeds LLM-driven analysis directly into the alerting pipeline, enabling intelligent root cause analysis and automated troubleshooting.

## Key Achievements

- 🤖 **From idea to MVP** — Designed and implemented the entire solution from scratch
- 🏆 **Leadership recognition** — Recognized by senior leadership for production hardening
- 📍 **Roadmap inclusion** — Selected for strategic product roadmap integration

## Technical Details

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server acts as a bridge between observability data and AI models, exposing structured tools for:

- Topology exploration and component search
- Metric analysis and anomaly detection  
- Monitor status and health state queries
- Trace analysis for distributed systems

Built with **Go**, integrating with **SUSE Observability (StackState)** for federated multi-cluster observability.
